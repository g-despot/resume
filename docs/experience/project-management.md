# Project Management & Agile Methodology

In my career, I have effectively utilized **project management** and **Agile methodologies** to lead diverse teams and deliver complex projects. As the lead developer for the Python OGM GQLAlchemy, I **guided the development team** through agile practices, ensuring timely and high-quality releases. I have also **supervised analytics sessions** focused on understanding user behavior through telemetry data and web analytics, driving data-informed decisions. Additionally, I have **managed developer relations engineers and technical writers**, supporting them in their daily tasks and fostering a collaborative environment. Below are some key ways I have applied these methodologies to achieve successful outcomes:

- **Agile Methodology**: Spearheaded the adoption of Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, across various teams, resulting in enhanced collaboration, faster delivery cycles, and improved product quality. [`Airtable`, `GitHub Projects`, `Microsoft Planner`]
- **Facilitated Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Coordinated with cross-functional teams, including developers, designers, and C-level execs, to ensure alignment on project goals and delivery timelines using Agile frameworks. Conducted regular stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives to maintain focus and foster continuous improvement.
- **Managed Product Backlog and Roadmap**: Effectively managed product backlogs and roadmaps, prioritizing features and tasks based on business value, user feedback, and technical dependencies. Ensured clear communication of priorities and expectations to development teams and the developer community. [`Notion`, `Airtable`, `GitHub Projects`, `Jira`]
- **Metrics-Driven Project Management**: Utilized Agile metrics, such as burndown charts, velocity, and cycle time, to monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to improve team efficiency and project outcomes.
- **Participated in the Hiring and Onboarding Process**: Contributed to the growth of high-performing teams by creating job requirements, conducting technical interviews with candidates, and providing mentorship during the onboarding process to ensure new team members quickly became productive and integrated into the Agile environment. 
- **Supervised Summer Internship Program**: Managed the summer internship program by designing meaningful tasks and projects for interns, providing hands-on mentorship, and guiding them through Agile workflows, which helped develop their technical skills and fostered a deep understanding of real-world software development practices.
