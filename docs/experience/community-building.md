# Community building

As one of the founding DevRel engineers, my job heavily focused on ensuring seamless communication in the developer community. My responsibilities included the creation of new channels from the ground up as well as the management of existing ones:
- **Discord Server Management**: Set up and managed a vibrant Discord community, including the creation and organization of channels, moderation, and member engagement.
- **Discourse Forum Administration**: Led the management of a Discourse forum, facilitating discussions, implementing moderation policies, and ensuring a positive and constructive environment.
- **Multi-Channel Community Oversight**: Provided oversight for various online community channels, including Reddit and Stack Overflow, ensuring consistent engagement and addressing user inquiries.
- **User Interaction**: Actively interacted with users through blog posts and video comments, responding to questions, providing support, and fostering a sense of community.
- **Event Participation and Presentation**: Regularly attended and presented at [industry meetups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b865jn1ZASM) and conferences, both in-person and remotely, contributing to discussions and sharing expertise.
- **Organizing Community Events and Hackathons**: Organization of community events like the [Graph Data Zagreb](https://www.meetup.com/graph-data-zagreb/) meetup and [Memgraph App Challenge](https://memgraph.com/blog/memgraph-app-challenge) hackathon.
