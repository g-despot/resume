# Technical writing

Throughout my career, I have consistently engaged in various technical writing projects across multiple roles, focusing on clear and effective communication of complex information.

- **Technical Communication**: Translated complex technical specifications into clear, concise formats such as slide decks for sales teams, detailed project requirements, and press releases, ensuring that technical information is accessible and understandable for a variety of audiences.
- **GitHub Documentation**: I have maintained several GitHub repositories, developing comprehensive content such as READMEs, CONTRIBUTING guides, WIKIs, FAQs, and other essential documentation to enhance user experience and contributor onboarding.
- **Software Documentation**: Leveraging frameworks like [Docusaurus](https://memgraph-archive-docs.netlify.app/), Gatsby, and GitBook, I have created, implemented, and maintained official software documentation, including detailed references, step-by-step tutorials, "how-to" guides, and API specifications.
- **Automated Documentation**: I utilized tools like `Doxygen` for `C` and `Sphinx` for `Python` to generate automated documentation, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the documentation process.
- **Educational materials**: Creating materials for the purpose of educating and targeting specific audiences like [NetworkX guide](https://memgraph.github.io/networkx-guide/basics/) and [Graph Analytics for Python Developers](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph-academy).
- **Technical Blogging**: I have authored numerous technical blog posts, delivering in-depth content that spans various domains such as [social network analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-visualize-a-social-network-in-python-with-a-graph-database-flask-docker-d3-js-af451db57330), [fraud detection](https://gdespot.medium.com/how-to-develop-a-credit-card-fraud-detection-application-using-memgraph-flask-and-d3-js-15ced962e3f0), and [blockchain analysis](https://gdespot.medium.com/building-a-bitclout-social-network-visualization-app-with-memgraph-and-d3-js-f2ebd4eaec27).
