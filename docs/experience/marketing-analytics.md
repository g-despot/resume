# Marketing & Analytics

As a DevRel engineer, my job often focused on tracking conversion rates, from observers to community members to customers. I have extensive experience in **web analytics** and **data tracking**, which are essential for understanding user behavior and for optimizing the developer experience. 

While working at a startup that was trying to pinpoint its **product/market fit**, target audience and tech niche, I often participated in and led projects that executed **growth experiments**. Projects like hackathons, educational courses, community giveaways and similar events provided crucial information to understand the needs of developers. By analyzing traffic data, usage information, A/B testing results and customer interviews, I helped identify and implement improvements in core products, documentation sources as well as marketing and sales materials. 

Some of my skills include:
- **Product Roadmap Development**: Analyzed user telemetry and feedback to create a strategic product roadmap, prioritize feature requests, and identify key areas for product improvements, ensuring alignment with user needs and market trends.
- **Segment Integration**: Collecting and analyzing data from various analytics tools (`Google Analytics`, `Facebook Pixel`, telemetry data) through Segment, enabling seamless data flow into a unified system. (`Zapier`, `HubSpot`, `Customer.io`)
- **SQL Analysis**: Used `SQL` to query and analyze collected data, transforming raw analytics into actionable insights that drive decision-making and optimization strategies.
- **User interviews**: Organized and performed user interviews in order to collect direct feedback from developers. 
- **Google Analytics & Facebook Pixel**: Implemented and managed `Google Analytics` and `Facebook Pixel` to track and analyze website performance, user engagement, the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and conversion metrics over multiple websites and apps.
- **Hotjar**: Leveraged `Hotjar` for heatmaps, session recordings, and user feedback to gain deeper insights into how developers interact with various websites and documentation sources.
